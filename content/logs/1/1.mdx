# Initial Commit

## A Little AI Story

So, I started this repo with the idea of using AI to supercharge my personal blog. Thought it'd be fun, efficientâ€¦ maybe even a little futuristic. ðŸš€

Fast forward a bit, and what actually happened? I ended up doing some **vibe coding**â€”just following random ideas, experimenting, and, wellâ€¦ hitting burnout city more times than I'd like to admit. ðŸ˜…

## The Turning Point

That led me to a simple decision: **I'm stepping back from integrating AI directly into my IDE**. From now on, AI will be my brainstorming buddy, my idea sparker, but not the thing I code alongside 24/7.

## My Take on AI

I'm not hating on AIâ€”far from it! But compared to my "pre-AI coding era," I realized something important: sometimes you just need to pause, reflect, and trust your own brain (even if it's a little slower than AI).

> Coding with AI is coolâ€¦ but coding yourself is still pretty awesome too.
