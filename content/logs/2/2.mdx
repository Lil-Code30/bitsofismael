As time goes you on, as I continue on my journey to be a great programmer/developer/ engineer or call it as you want, I am just losing interest and I donâ€™t really know why. Meanwhile it is what I want to become in future and dream of. Maybe I am just afraid of this AI thing and I am just convinced it will replace us (software engineer/developer/programmer ) as all those greats Tech people say. But like usual I donâ€™t really give a f\*\*ck about what they says ðŸ˜…Â at first yes but now I am just like yes AI will replace use and so what ?

I have a dream and I must complete it not just the end point but the journey.

## What I want to become ?

Currently I canâ€™t answer this question but what I know deep in my heart is that I just want to create, solve problems and help people. I have already admitted that may be in future, I will never have that dream job or accomplish what I want but this canâ€™t stop me from continuing coding, doing live streaming, helping as much people I can, encouraging people to continue doing what they are passionate about.

Lets me just continue doing what I am passionate and stop giving a f\*\*ck about all those big company are saying

- Do they really control the world ?

- What are we becoming ?

- Is evolution = frustration ?

- What next ?

- Yes, AI we replace us

- Maybe I am wrong

- Maybeâ€¦
