Yes I have admitted it, yes I use AI. yes yes and yes üòì

In fact I needed to talk about this aspect not just AI but the fact that we, yes we. We are trying to replace human beings with robots, machines, Artificial Intelligence something like that.

## What next ?

I have been thinking of this aspect ever since but I never had answers. Is Evolution = replace every single person with a robot, machine ‚Ä¶ etc ? We are on earth in a planet where all humans being lives and contributing to the planet, paying their bills, taxes, managing thier lives and so on. But when I see all these tech companies creating robots looking like humans, creating AI to do people works these brings me a question. **What next ?** Yes I respect all these stuffs because I myself is passionated of those stuffs but what next ? Just imagine a world where every thing in the world is done by AI, robots etc what are we going to be then ? Because as far as I know, bills, taxes etc are being paid buy us humans and if we are no more able to work, how are we going to manage our lives, **how are we going to live ?** **what will be the next step?**

> Yes evolution is good but I what cost ?

## My theory

For sure evolution is good and it is what we say we are trying to make the world a better place to live but I think instead of trying to create things that us humans being like to do or are passionate about, can‚Äôt we create things that fix or do things that humans do not want to do or is too hard (risky) to be done by a human being?

Currently I don‚Äôt know what or how but let us think about it.

I donot hate AI, but I can say it is the direction of the usage or ... that I hate.

üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è Just the first title that popup on my mind.

> Have a Nice and wonderful day. May God bless Your ‚ù§Ô∏è.
