Hey, this is me again. I just wanted to write something today.

You know what ? just stop, do people care ? no.

I currently hate the internet and I hate myself for not following the trend.

AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AIIIIIIII this is what I see everywhere.

F\*\*ck you, F\*\*k me, F\*\*k everybody and F\*\*k AI and the creator.

Maybe I am like this bcs I am feeling left behind or what, I donot know.

Sometimes I even want that AI to replace all devs, robot to replace all human beings.

The motivation to continue the journey is dissolving. I am Lost, and I hate myself. I think is AI concept is making programming no more fun. I think it is destroying everything. I think we should just stop with it.

Maybe I am afraid that I will never get a job in this domain. Already two years no tech job. I donot have a cs degree, I am a self taught even if I know nothing. I have never worked on some real projects just my little projects that no one use.

I need money, I need a lot of money.

I neeeeeed **1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 billions**.

Infact never mind all what I wrote above, I was just angry. But just know that currently nothing can stop me from coding and even if in future I never have that dream job. I will still love programming solving problemd with code. That is why I am starting over with a well roadmap (main focus : Backend). I will post every I will do here.

> 2025-10-24T22:10:00 I promise myself to never stop what I am doing even what happen. I will continue untill I die.

### Daily reminder

I think I care way tooo much about this AI stuff. And I want to let you know that if you care too about this AI, you know what? just stop and do something else because it may caused you health problems for nothing.

Also use AI. If you want

So just stop and enjoy life the rest doesnot matter too and more as your health,family friends, love onces.

> Trust in the Lord

The Goal doesnot matter, enjoy the journey.

#### Fun fact this is not a motivation speach. If you want to stop, just stop whor cares ? Nobody

_Have a nice day_.
