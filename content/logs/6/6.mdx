Hey there. Last Time I said that I want to do everything but now I am overwhelmed, I started learning Chess game, I am currently doing some donuts in blender ([check it here ](https://www.youtube.com/live/OuJHgVfGY08?si=1f_8ztSY4FsQbf9H)), Backend journey, school, night job, fatigue. All this for me alone. Like it is hard to manage, and I am lost but I do not want to abandon the journey. I think I am not managing my time well or It is just that I want to learn many things at once

Currently I still want to do all of what I mention on my last log ([log/5](https://bitsofismael.vercel.app/logs/5)).

And I donot know what to do inorder to manage it.

> Lost on the path, wanting ti be perfect.

Have a nice day. Take Care
